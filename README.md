Objective: Developed a sentiment analysis model to classify Kindle reviews as positive or negative.
Techniques: Applied text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization using NLTK.
Feature Engineering: Trained a custom Word2Vec model, along with Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, for feature
extraction.
Outcome: Achieved the highest accuracy with the custom Word2Vec features, outperforming Bag-of-Words
and TF-IDF models using Gaussian Naive Bayes.
